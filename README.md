It is Javascript quiz about Coronavirus.
I have 5 simple questions ready.
If you click on get started the quiz starts right away
I used to 120 seconds for each question and it pauses the quiz when you select the answer.
It lets you know if the answer right/wrong.
If the you answer it wrong, it subtracts penalty time from the clock.
Once you finish the quiz you will be able to see ending score.
You can enter your initials.
Once you enter your initials you will be able to see the highscores.
You can clear your high socres if you don't like and start over the quiz if you want.
